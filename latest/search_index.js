    "text": "HTTP.get(uri) -> Response\nHTTP.get(client::HTTP.Client, uri) -> Response\n\nBuild and execute an http \"GET\" request. Query parameters can be passed via the query keyword argument as a Dict. Multiple query parameters with the same key can be passed like Dict(\"key1\"=>[\"value1\", \"value2\"], \"key2\"=>...). Returns a Response object that includes the resulting status code (HTTP.status(r) and HTTP.statustext(r)), response headers (HTTP.headers(r)), cookies (HTTP.cookies(r)), response history if redirects were involved (HTTP.history(r)), and response body (HTTP.body(r) or take!(String, r) or take!(r)).\n\nThe body or payload for a request can be given through the body keyword arugment. The body can be given as a String, Vector{UInt8}, IO, HTTP.FIFOBuffer or Dict argument type. See examples below for how to use an HTTP.FIFOBuffer for asynchronous streaming uploads. If the body is provided as a Dict, the request body will be uploaded using the multipart/form-data encoding. The key-value pairs in the Dict will constitute the name and value of each multipart boundary chunk. Files and other large data arguments can be provided as values as IO arguments: either an IOStream such as returned via open(file), an IOBuffer for in-memory data, or even an HTTP.FIFOBuffer. For complete control over the multipart details, an HTTP.Multipart type is provided to support setting the Content-Type, filename, and Content-Transfer-Encoding if desired. See ?HTTP.Multipart for more details.\n\nAdditional keyword arguments supported, include:\n\nheaders::Dict{String,String}: headers given as Dict to be sent with the request\nbody: a request body can be given as a String, Vector{UInt8}, IO, HTTP.FIFOBuffer or Dict; see example below for how to utilize HTTP.FIFOBuffer for \"streaming\" request bodies; a Dict argument will be converted to a multipart form upload\nstream::Bool=false: enable response body streaming; depending on the response body size, the request will return before the full body has been received; as the response body is read, additional bytes will be recieved and put in the response body. Readers should read until eof(response.body) == true; see below for an example of response streaming\nchunksize::Int: if a request body is larger than chunksize, the \"chunked-transfer\" http mechanism will be used and chunks will be sent no larger than chunksize\nconnecttimeout::Float64: sets a timeout on how long to wait when trying to connect to a remote host; default = 10.0 seconds\nreadtimeout::Float64: sets a timeout on how long to wait when receiving a response from a remote host; default = 9.0 seconds\ntlsconfig::TLS.SSLConfig: a valid TLS.SSLConfig which will be used to initialize every https connection\nmaxredirects::Int: the maximum number of redirects that will automatically be followed for an http request\nallowredirects::Bool: whether redirects should be allowed to be followed at all; default = true\nforwardheaders::Bool: whether user-provided headers should be forwarded on redirects; default = false\nretries::Int: # of times a request will be tried before throwing an error; default = 3\n\nSimple request example:\n\njulia> resp = HTTP.get(\"http://httpbin.org/ip\")\nHTTP.Response:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 32\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nDate: Fri, 06 Jan 2017 05:07:07 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nServer: nginx\n\n{\n  \"origin\": \"65.130.216.45\"\n}\n\n\njulia> string(resp)\n\"{\n  \"origin\": \"65.130.216.45\"\n}\n\"\n\nResponse streaming example:\n\njulia> r = HTTP.get(\"http://httpbin.org/stream/100\"; stream=true)\nHTTP.Response:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\njulia> body = HTTP.body(r)\nHTTP.FIFOBuffer(0,1048576,0,1,1,UInt8[],Condition(Any[]),Task (runnable) @0x000000010d221690,false)\n\njulia> while true\n    println(String(readavailable(body)))\n    eof(body) && break\nend\n{\"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/stream/100\", \"headers\": {\"Host\": \"httpbin.org\", \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\", \"User-Agent\": \"HTTP.jl/0.0.0\"}, \"args\": {}, \"id\": 0, \"origin\": \"65.130.216.45\"}\n{\"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/stream/100\", \"headers\": {\"Host\": \"httpbin.org\", \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\", \"User-Agent\": \"HTTP.jl/0.0.0\"}, \"args\": {}, \"id\": 1, \"origin\": \"65.130.216.45\"}\n{\"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/stream/100\", \"headers\": {\"Host\": \"httpbin.org\", \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\", \"User-Agent\": \"HTTP.jl/0.0.0\"}, \"args\": {}, \"id\": 2, \"origin\": \"65.130.216.45\"}\n{\"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/stream/100\", \"headers\": {\"Host\": \"httpbin.org\", \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\", \"User-Agent\": \"HTTP.jl/0.0.0\"}, \"args\": {}, \"id\": 3, \"origin\": \"65.130.216.45\"}\n...\n\nRequest streaming example:\n\n# create a FIFOBuffer for sending our request body\nf = HTTP.FIFOBuffer()\n# write initial data\nwrite(f, \"hey\")\n# start an HTTP.post asynchronously\nt = @async HTTP.post(\"http://httpbin.org/post\"; body=f)\nwrite(f, \" there \") # as we write to f, it triggers another chunk to be sent in our async request\nwrite(f, \"sailor\")\nclose(f) # setting eof on f causes the async request to send a final chunk and return the response\n\nresp = wait(t) # get our response by getting the result of our asynchronous task\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At this point, the FIFOBuffer is full and will return 0 for all subsequent writes. If no max argument is given, then a default size of typemax(Int32)^2 is used; this essentially allows all writes every time.\n\nReading is supported via readavailable(f) and read(f, nb), which returns all or nb bytes, respectively, starting at the earliest bytes written.\n\nYou may call String(f::FIFOBuffer) to view the current contents in the buffer without consuming them.\n\nA FIFOBuffer is built to be used asynchronously to allow buffered reading and writing. In particular, a FIFOBuffer detects if it is being read from/written to the main task, or asynchronously, and will behave slightly differently depending on which.\n\nSpecifically, when reading from a FIFOBuffer, if accessed from the main task, it will not block if there are no bytes available to read, instead returning an empty UInt8[]. If being read from asynchronously, however, reading will block until additional bytes have been written. An example of this in action is:\n\nf = HTTP.FIFOBuffer(5) # create a FIFOBuffer that will hold at most 5 bytes, currently empty\nf2 = HTTP.FIFOBuffer(5) # a 2nd buffer that we'll write to asynchronously\n\n# start an asynchronous writing task with the 2nd buffer\ntsk = @async begin\n    while !eof(f)\n        write(f2, readavailable(f))\n    end\nend\n\n# now write some bytes to the first buffer\n# writing triggers our async task to wake up and read the bytes we just wrote\n# leaving the first buffer empty again and blocking again until more bytes have been written\nwrite(f, [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05])\n\n# we can see that `f2` now holds the bytes we wrote to `f`\nString(readavailable(f2))\n\n# our async task will continue until `f` is closed\nclose(f)\n\nistaskdone(tsk) # true\n\n\n\n"
