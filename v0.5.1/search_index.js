    "text": "HTTP.get(uri; kwargs...) -> Response\nHTTP.get(client::HTTP.Client, uri; kwargs...) -> Response\n\nBuild and execute an http \"GET\" request. Query parameters can be passed via the query keyword argument as a Dict. Multiple query parameters with the same key can be passed like Dict(\"key1\"=>[\"value1\", \"value2\"], \"key2\"=>...). Returns a Response object that includes the resulting status code (HTTP.status(r) and HTTP.statustext(r)), response headers (HTTP.headers(r)), cookies (HTTP.cookies(r)), response history if redirects were involved (HTTP.history(r)), and response body (HTTP.body(r) or String(r) or take!(r)).\n\nThe body or payload for a request can be given through the body keyword arugment. The body can be given as a String, Vector{UInt8}, IO, HTTP.FIFOBuffer or Dict argument type. See examples below for how to use an HTTP.FIFOBuffer for asynchronous streaming uploads.\n\nIf the body is provided as a Dict, the request body will be uploaded using the multipart/form-data encoding. The key-value pairs in the Dict will constitute the name and value of each multipart boundary chunk. Files and other large data arguments can be provided as values as IO arguments: either an IOStream such as returned via open(file), an IOBuffer for in-memory data, or even an HTTP.FIFOBuffer. For complete control over the multipart details, an HTTP.Multipart type is provided to support setting the Content-Type, filename, and Content-Transfer-Encoding if desired. See ?HTTP.Multipart for more details.\n\nAdditional keyword arguments supported, include:\n\nheaders::Dict{String,String}: headers given as Dict to be sent with the request\nbody: a request body can be given as a String, Vector{UInt8}, IO, HTTP.FIFOBuffer or Dict; see example below for how to utilize HTTP.FIFOBuffer for \"streaming\" request bodies; a Dict argument will be converted to a multipart form upload\nstream::Bool=false: enable response body streaming; depending on the response body size, the request will return before the full body has been received; as the response body is read, additional bytes will be recieved and put in the response body. Readers should read until eof(response.body) == true; see below for an example of response streaming\nchunksize::Int: if a request body is larger than chunksize, the \"chunked-transfer\" http mechanism will be used and chunks will be sent no larger than chunksize; default = nothing\nconnecttimeout::Float64: sets a timeout on how long to wait when trying to connect to a remote host; default = 10.0 seconds\nreadtimeout::Float64: sets a timeout on how long to wait when receiving a response from a remote host; default = 9.0 seconds\ntlsconfig::TLS.SSLConfig: a valid TLS.SSLConfig which will be used to initialize every https connection; default = nothing\nmaxredirects::Int: the maximum number of redirects that will automatically be followed for an http request; default = 5\nallowredirects::Bool: whether redirects should be allowed to be followed at all; default = true\nforwardheaders::Bool: whether user-provided headers should be forwarded on redirects; default = false\nretries::Int: # of times a request will be tried before throwing an error; default = 3\nmanagecookies::Bool: whether the request client should automatically store and add cookies from/to requests (following appropriate host-specific & expiration rules); default = true\nstatusraise::Bool: whether an HTTP.StatusError should be raised on a non-2XX response status code; default = true\ninsecure::Bool: whether an \"https\" connection should allow insecure connections (no TLS verification); default = false\ncanonicalizeheaders::Bool: whether header field names should be canonicalized in responses, e.g. content-type is canonicalized to Content-Type;

Note that providing a string or byte vector argument mirrors the behavior of Base.IOBuffer in that the max size of the FIFOBuffer is the length of the string/byte vector; it is also not writeable.\n\nReading is supported via readavailable(f) and read(f, nb), which returns all or nb bytes, respectively, starting at the earliest bytes written. All read functions will return an empty byte vector, even if the buffer has been closed. Checking eof will correctly reflect when the buffer has been closed and no more bytes will be available for reading.\n\nYou may call String(f::FIFOBuffer) to view the current contents in the buffer without consuming them.\n\nA FIFOBuffer is built to be used asynchronously to allow buffered reading and writing. In particular, a FIFOBuffer detects if it is being read from/written to the main task, or asynchronously, and will behave slightly differently depending on which.\n\nSpecifically, when reading from a FIFOBuffer, if accessed from the main task, it will not block if there are no bytes available to read, instead returning an empty UInt8[]. If being read from asynchronously, however, reading will block until additional bytes have been written. An example of this in action is:\n\nf = HTTP.FIFOBuffer(5) # create a FIFOBuffer that will hold at most 5 bytes, currently empty\nf2 = HTTP.FIFOBuffer(5) # a 2nd buffer that we'll write to asynchronously\n\n# start an asynchronous writing task with the 2nd buffer\ntsk = @async begin\n    while !eof(f)\n        write(f2, readavailable(f))\n    end\nend\n\n# now write some bytes to the first buffer\n# writing triggers our async task to wake up and read the bytes we just wrote\n# leaving the first buffer empty again and blocking again until more bytes have been written\nwrite(f, [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05])\n\n# we can see that `f2` now holds the bytes we wrote to `f`\nString(readavailable(f2))\n\n# our async task will continue until `f` is closed\nclose(f)\n\nistaskdone(tsk) # true\n\n\n\n"
